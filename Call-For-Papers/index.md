### CFP Guidelines

Submissions are limited to a total of 5 pages, including all content and references. There will be no page limit for supplemental materials. All submissions must be in PDF format and use ACM Conference Proceeding templates (two-column format). One recommended setting for Latex file of anonymous manuscript is: `\documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}`. Template guidelines are <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">here</a>.

Following this KDD conference submission policy, reviews are double-blind, and author names and affiliations should NOT be listed. Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental methods and results should be clear, well-executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make data and code publicly available whenever possible. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the KDD proceedings.

Submit your paper through the <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/EAIKDDworkshop2024">EAI-KDD workshop CMT submission site</a>.

Upon notification, we ask that authors of accepted works deanonymize their papers, make any final changes, and then submit a camera-ready version to the CMT submission site. The workshop website will then be updated with links to accepted papers. Note that accepted works will not be formally published. This means that:

- Authors can retain full copyright of their works.
- Works in accepted papers are not precluded from being published in other research venues.
- Submitted papers are allowed to have significant overlap with previously published or currently submitted work (in this case, please indicate overlapping works).
