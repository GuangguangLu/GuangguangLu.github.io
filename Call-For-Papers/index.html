        </h3>
        <p>Submissions are limited to a total of 5 pages, including all content and references. There will be no page
            limit for supplemental materials. All submissions must be in PDF format and use ACM Conference Proceeding
            templates (two-column format). One recommended setting for Latex file of anonymous manuscript is: <code>\documentclass[sigconf,
                anonymous, review]&#123;acmart&#125;</code>. Template guidelines are <a class="header__link1 target="
                                                                                        _blank" rel="noopener"

        </p>
        <p>Following this KDD conference submission policy, reviews are double-blind, and author names and affiliations
            should NOT be listed. Submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential
            impact, and clarity of writing. For papers that rely heavily on empirical evaluations, the experimental
            methods and results should be clear, well-executed, and repeatable. Authors are strongly encouraged to make
            data and code publicly available whenever possible. The accepted papers will be posted on the workshop
            website but will not be included in the KDD proceedings.</p>
        <p>Submit your paper through the <a class="header__link1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                                            href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=sdbd24">easychair submission
            site</a>.</p>
        <p>Upon notification, we ask that authors of accepted works deanonymize their papers, make any final changes,
            and then submit a camera-ready version to the CMT submission site. The workshop website will then be updated
            with links to accepted papers. Note that accepted works will not be formally published. This means that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authors can retain full copyright of their works.</li>
            <li>Works in accepted papers are not precluded from being published in other research venues.</li>
            <li>Submitted papers are allowed to have significant overlap with previously published or currently
                submitted work (in this case, please indicate overlapping works).
            </li>
        </ul>
